          God is building a home. He’s using us all—irrespective of how we got
          here—in what he is building. He used the apostles and prophets for the
          foundation. Now he’s using you, fitting you in brick by brick, stone
          by stone, with Christ Jesus as the cornerstone that holds all the
          parts together. We see it taking shape day after day—a holy temple
          built by God, all of us built into it, a temple in which God is quite
          at home. (Ephesians 2:19-22)

          Leaving the outside world behind, you enter through the doors into a
          vast, brightly lit auditorium in which a crowd of many bodies has
          gathered. You join them in the rows of tiered seating to face a wide
          stage. A well-dressed man is speaking to the crowd with a warm
          familiarity in his voice. His tone is one of confident authority. He
          begins to tell you a story you have heard before. His performance
          builds, he brings it to life with passionate gesture and dramatic
          emphasis, and this time it takes on a new resonance. Now a choir
          dressed in co-ordinated rainbow bright colours stands and youthful,
          glossy looking performers take the stage. The music is overwhelmingly
          loud. It is upbeat and contemporary, it feels familiar. The lyrics
          tell you that all things are possible. You feel hope swelling within
          your chest as the vibrations from the loudspeakers travel up into your
          body. You join in with the others in the crowd to sing that God is
          with you, He is on your side, He will help you overcome your troubles.
          The atmosphere of expectation in the room is tangible. Believers hold
          up their hands, reaching out to the presence that seems to have
          materialised within the space above them, brought into being by the
          effervescent song. Although it does not yet make sense in your head,
          your body is powerless to resist this message that you are being made
          new. You are open, and your belief that all will be well, as small as
          a mustard seed, is growing. Emotion stirs deep within you. A lump
          forms in your throat, tears sting at the back of your eyelids and you
          feel a tense concretion of feeling inside your stomach. As you sing
          and shake with emotion, the children are being filtered out, away from
          the adults, directed into the interior space of ‘Children’s Church’…

          In ‘Shelter House’, Grace Crothall forensically examines the
          displacements and separations of contemporary Christianity –
          specifically expressions of the Pentecostal-Charismatic movement from
          the 1990s – through an irreverent method: categories of holy and
          unholy, insider and outsider, adult and child, and knowledge and
          innocence collide. Crothall deliberately brings these separations into
          a disquieting and playful entanglement. Visual, material, spatial and
          auditory representations from Pentecostal-Charismatic culture are
          juxtaposed. As a former insider, Crothall describes her approach as
          that of an autopsy, aiming to reveal the hidden and contradictory
          inner life of the type of church to which she once belonged.

          The global megachurch Hillsong, part of the Pentecostal-Charismatic
          movement, began in Australia in 1983 and has been influential on the
          development of Antipodean Protestantism. Characteristic of this type
          of church is the centrality of belief in the authority of the Bible
          (presented as a coherent narrative) as a foundational ground on which
          the church community is produced and sustained. This creates a culture
          where leadership, in their retellings of and preaching from a text
          that is considered inerrant, functions as a stand in for divine
          authority. To doubt or question the leadership or the church culture
          as shaped by the leadership is to invert the ‘natural’ order of God
          over man. To assert yourself through critical, independent thinking is
          viewed as unbiblical, unholy and ‘worldly’. It is to view yourself as
          both equal to the leaders (you are not) and is also to question God
          (which is sacrilegious). Divergent thinking, or thinking for yourself,
          threatens the integrity of the unassailable logic of the institution.
          Believers are encouraged to hold firm to bible verses that promote a
          child-like faith. In both Mark and Matthew Jesus tells us that we must
          become like children in order to inherent the Kingdom of God, and 1
          Corinthians reads: (for) ‘God chose the foolish things of the world to
          shame the wise’ (1 Corinthians 1:27). Uncritically following Church
          leadership is part of the same culture where the believer also
          swallows the contradictory elements and elisions of the Bible,
          reordering it into a coherent whole that foregrounds the good news of
          the redemption story through which salvation is found. It is a culture
          in which norms of adult and child are, on occasion, reversed. The
          adult believer has access to a stable ground of existence through this
          authorized good news narrative. From this stable ground their eyes are
          fixed on the heavenly, eternal world, and not material reality that
          surrounds them. The difficult, challenging, problematic or complex is
          excluded and the feel-good story is clung to. The child however, is
          immersed through Sunday school or ‘Children’s Church’ into the less
          coherent and sometimes troubling violence of old testament Bible
          stories, in which God punishes his wayward people with plagues, he
          orders genocides on non-believing nations and pronounces the death
          penalty on children who hit or curse their parents.

          The children are following Christiana, this week’s Children’s Church
          assistant, out of the auditorium and into the cosy confines of an
          inner room. Today they are being told a story of Jonah and the Whale.
          Later they will colour in pictures of Jonah trapped inside the whale’s
          belly. Some will draw in little fish and sandwiches and apples and
          sweets all swirling around inside the interior along with poor old
          Jonah. Some will think that he was naughty and got what he deserved.
          Some will think about the punishment that God threatens the city of
          Nineva with, and the punishment inflicted on Jonah, all green with
          whale bile and scared, hungry and waiting to be vomited up. They will
          grow frightened. They will internalize this story, it will sit within
          them like a stone in the gut and a bilious fear will rise when they
          next step out of line.

          Churches such as Hillsong are typified by an insistence on high levels
          of participation. New seekers are strongly encouraged to join and are
          quickly encompassed within the life of the church. In
          ‘Seeker-friendly: The Hillsong Megachurch as an Enchanting Total
          Institution’ sociologist Matthew Wade writes that Hillsong: ‘aspires
          to be a ‘full-service’ Church, where, once sufficiently integrated,
          life within the church can become ‘allencompassing’ for the
          individual.’ (2015: 667) Churches provide a structure and order for
          life, embedding seekers within the culture, meeting their needs for
          community, work and leisure. Hillsong churches are described as
          ‘campuses’: alongside weekly services a range of other functions and
          ways to participate are offered, including bookshops, cafes,
          childcare, groups for teens and students and voluntary work. Within
          the Pentecostal-Charismatic movement at large, once a person has
          committed their life to God, faith becomes the lens through which
          everything is viewed, whether in work, at home, in relationships, at
          leisure, all aspects of life are brought within the purview of
          sustaining and spreading faith. Church is not confined to two hours on
          a Sunday, participation occurs around the clock through weekly groups,
          voluntary work and evangelism. Christians are encouraged to have quiet
          times with God before the day begins, to prayerfully consider each
          decision, to invite God into their relationships and marriages and to
          see their workplace as part of their mission. Faith becomes the
          foundation for life, it is everywhere and in everything.
          Pentecostal-Charismatic churches enable these totalizing paradigms of
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wade states that the aim of churches such as Hillsong is to achieve
          the exclusive and undivided loyalty of its members in: ‘tying the
          organization and all its activities to a higher, collective purpose,
          namely that of ‘saving’ the ‘unsaved’ (2015: 669). Slowly, other more
          secular activities are discouraged unless they are part of a member’s
          outreach to the unsaved. Congregants are aware of desired behaviours,
          and accordingly self-regulate. Whilst there are no overtly stated
          rules, there are certain expectations in regards to social and
          behavioural mores. Deviation from certain norms risks disapproval and
          exclusion. The church maintains a soft exterior, enabling the
          unchurched and religious seekers to join in without the cultural
          tension that traditional churches provoke, but at the heart of the
          church there is a hard core of power hierarchies, expected behaviours
          and cognitive dissonance in normalizing the contradictory aspects of a
          good news story of a loving Father with a Biblical history of
          violence.

          You are making your way out from the rows of seating to join the
          queues of people waiting to receive communion. You tear off some bread
          and place it on your tongue. Your teeth and saliva chew it, mash it
          down, make it slippery. You swallow it. This small morsel of
          nourishment represents a body: the God-man protagonist at the heart of
          the good news story you have just internalised. A body-story consumed
          by a body. A ritual of remembrance and identification. You are
          becoming what you eat. The wheat cells break down and are digested in
          your gut, shifting across the intestinal membrane, entering your blood
          stream and working their way through your body.
          <br />
          <br />
          You move at a languid pace, through an endless tunnel. The interior is
          a pale pink with a network of dark red veins, and is slick with
          wetness. Contractions in the walls propel you forwards, interminably
          on through this folded interior. You are a concretion of matter, a
          bolus whose edges are slowly loosening, being absorbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the church is a site in which the good news story creates a world
          in which believers live and thrive, if it is a container in which a
          particular embodiment of faith, one that is certain and unassailable,
          forms a collective culture of difference, of resistance to the
          shifting and multiple logic of the secular world around it, a culture
          of inside and out, holy and unholy, believer and those
          yet-to-be-saved, then how might this site also function as a kind of
          body?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pentecostal-Charismatic church is a body-like container for many
          bodies, it’s boundaries separating the bodies inside from outside
          bodies, but the doors are always open to new believers. A superficial
          sheen of modernity casts an appealing glow through the use of
          contemporary music and technology, bright, corporate looking interiors
          and non-religious architecture, and an avoidance of overt religious
          symbolism. A global belief system that has morphed and shifted through
          two millennia of societal changes is presented as a shiny, happy
          family in which the body, viewed as a volatile, leaky, desiring
          presence is always policed, repressed, negated by a wholesome culture.
          Church is not the place of the imminent-animal body, not leaky,
          porous, desiring open flesh, it is the place of a body that must
          transcend its’ embodiment, it must be skybound, eyes fixed on the
          heavens. These separations allow the church body to function. In the
          relentless focus on a transcendent imaginary – the desire to escape
          earthly finitude and reach God – the body is overlooked as merely a
          channel, an empty vessel for God’s glory. And yet the body, its
          desires, fears, and repressions are continuously and contradictorily
          summoned within the cultural space of the Pentecostal-Charismatic
          movement. The congregation sings passionately, dances, lays hands on
          those who need prayer, in addition to the embodied experience of being
          filled with the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues, shaking, weeping and
          many other fervent bodily experiences. This culture, where certain
          activities are acceptable because they are oriented toward God, whilst
          others such as pre-marital sex are condemned, performs a paradox.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her book ‘Powers of Horror: An Essay in Abjection’ philosopher and
          literary critic Julia Kristeva writes of the necessity of the bodily
          repressions and taboos we enact socially in order to function. We
          cannot stand the site of the bodily waste and effluent, it is made
          private, shameful, fearful. Balls of hair, flakes of skin, human waste
          products such as blood, vomit and excrement cause revulsion and dismay
          because they remind us that our bodies are not discrete, do not have
          integrity, our bodies leak and flake and wound and ultimately, perish
          and decay. They are fearfully permeable, the outside finds its way in
          and the inside works its way out. On the deep sense of horror that the
          leaky or wounded body provokes, Kristeva remarks: ‘These body fluids,
          this defilement, this shit are what life withstands, hardly and with
          difficulty, on the part of death. There, I am at the border of my
          condition as a living being.’ (1980: 3) The sight of the abject
          propels the viewer into the destabilizing, liminal space of the
          boundary, neither out nor in, a place where the symbolic order with
          which we are usually able to placate ourselves in order to function
          collapses. Kristeva echoes anthropologist Mary Douglas whose work on
          religious purity rituals foregrounds the significance of ‘matter out
          of place’ – the seemingly human need to create boundaries, to make
          binary distinctions of pure/ impure, clean/ unclean. This is
          translated within religious ritual into holy/ unholy or sacred/
          profane where the impure is expelled from the bounds of both the
          individual and collective religious body. For Kristeva, it is both
          religion and art that deal with the abject: ‘The various means of
          purifying the abject—the various catharses—make up the history of
          religions, and end up with that catharsis par excellence called art,
          both on the far and near side of religion.’ (1980: 17)

          In ‘Shelter House’ we become the church body as we enter in to the
          quasi-church site that Crothall has created. She makes us a stand in
          for the congregant, a temporary part of the crowd of believers.
          However, Crothall subverts the norms of Pentecostal-Charismatic
          culture by literally depicting the interior of the body, referencing a
          messy and disturbing visceral world, a place where things are not
          static or fixed but in a process of becoming, transmuting, forming.
          Through foregrounding the gut in her colonoscopy images, through
          imagining the Children’s Church within the belly of the whale,
          Crothall’s work reframes the church, inverting it, re-thinking it as a
          site that reflects life in all its fearful complexity. In placing the
          viewer as a stand in for the believer within this site of uncertainty,
          of change, of liminality, we are offered the opportunity to be open to
          difference, to face the realities of our embodied experience, to be
          inclusive rather than exclusive. This forms a provocation not only for
          those within the comforting confines of Pentecostal-Charismatic
          Christianity, but also for all of us in our human desire to seek the
          security of binary thinking.
