        <p>
          Grace Crothall’s images of Christchurch motels hold a sense of
          waiting-room catatonia. Hard-edged, economic units in zombie-bland
          palettes. Exhaustive lists of boring amenities; “ironing facilities,
          free toiletries, shuttle to and from”. The intolerable tedium of
          everyday nessesities, stripped back to chilling uniformity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crothall plays the role of director, stage managing her scenes,
          outsourcing selected aspects of production.<sup>1</sup> Moonlighting
          as both set designer and special effects crew, the artist has added
          garnishes to her tepid interiors. Stills from the 1971 classic,
          <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i>, light up the motel flat
          screens, and home-made, velveteen snakes weave their way into shots;
          crumpled like discarded sleeves – spangled white, olive green,
          turquoise. These details tug at a suggestion of potent dark-fantasy –
          of something meaty and rotten, simmering under the anonymous materials
          of tightly measured and slightly grimy rooms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mel Stuart’s <i>Willy Wonka</i> has become a key source of glucose for
          Crothall’s work; the film’s influence flowing from its rich,
          subversive undercurrent. Think of The Chocolate Room, that
          lurid-industrial candy-field. Set designer Harper Goff’s chocolate
          river appears off-colour and watery, like rusty blood. A lingering
          shot of the surface features a slow stream of rising bubbles...the
          camera holds, what lies beneath? As noted by actress Julie Dawn Cole
          (Veruca Salt) in her memoir of the
          <i>Wonka</i> experience:
        </p>

        <div className="center-quote">
          ‘The special effects team used chemical dyes, along with a milk powder
          to create the chocolate appearance and textures seen on film...on at
          least one occasion, the water had to be drained when the color shifted
          to a reddish hue and gave off a foul musty smell that permeated the
          entire soundstage’.<sup>2</sup>
        </div>

        <p>
          The children are released into The Chocolate Room, and Veruca soon
          smashes open an immense striped orb (‘polysterene watermelon’),
          scooping out dark, fleshy slop with her bare hands. Dawn Cole
          describes this moment in detail:
        </p>

        <div className="center-quote">
          “The taste of this runny-textured chocolate gloop was so digusting
          that I could barely force myself to eat it, much less pretend that I
          was enjoying it...By the time this scene was completed, I felt ill
          from ingesting this chocolate-flavored nastiness”<sup>3</sup>
        </div>

        <p>
          And that lemon-yellow buttercup that Wonka bites into? Cast wax. Gene
          Wilder immediately spat out his mouthful as each take was completed.
          Likewise, in the scene featuring lickable wallpaper – Dawn Cole’s
          tongue was coated in a “powdery, chalky-tasting food coloring” to give
          it a candy-red tint.<sup>4</sup> For a final nasty note, those were
          live wasps in the inventing room, appearing as busy bees producing
          honey.
        </p>

        <p>
          Props causing mild gastric distress, a dank waft down the
          confectionery aisle...An element of decay in something presented as
          luxury. Here’s a parallel with Crothall’s beige motel rooms. Take her
          image of a spa bath, surrounded with spongy blue matting – you know
          those springy fibres are chock full of skin flakes, maybe some sneaky
          cigarette ash. Oh, the familiar experience of rental accomodation
          let-downs. That Super-king mattress has lumpy, polyester pillows (and
          a worn mink blanket). The shower is but a trickle, habouring whiffs of
          black mold, with a top-note of <i>JIF</i>. There’s a strange ochre
          residue inside the bar fridge, and the measly dose of instant coffee
          has hardened inside its paper sachet. This is not horror, it’s worse –
          an insidious and creeping sense of existential disappointment. The big
          holiday with the kids is a bit icky around the edges.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crothall’s imagery of sparse, constrained interiors builds a framework
          of strict control. <i>Heat Pits</i> situates this claustrophobic
          oppression within an educational context. The exhibition design plays
          on dated classroom formats, siphoning inspiration from Stuart’s{' '}
          <i>Willy Wonka</i>. Remember the weasel-faced teacher, lab-coat clad,
          glowering down at his pews of young charges? Chalk in hand, he is all
          knowing. The chalkboard itself takes on a domineering persona here –
          an elevated surface that dispenses hard information; chemical
          equations, percentages, black and white data – never to be questioned.
        </p>

        <p>
          The artist fully understands this object-oriented power structure,
          pulling physical cues from conventional chalkboards into her image
          display strategies. Large-scale prints are supported by a timber
          ledge; lining the gallery walls, mounted at ‘teaching’ height,
          constructed from framing of a width and shape suited to holding
          lengths of chalk. A custom-made, triangular school table is centred in
          the gallery space – sharp angles and flat planes; the antithesis of
          childish squish and sprawl. This structure references spatial control
          of small bodies, while simultaneously operating as a mechanism to
          direct the traffic of viewers.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the dark heart of <i>Heat Pits</i> is a slithering presence,
          penetrating the machine of stale control, leaving traces of its
          progress. Offcast disguises, outgrown by the fiend. A snake will shed
          its skin periodically throughout its lifetime; a process also known as{' '}
          <i>molting</i>, or <i>sloughing</i>. An internal layer of the old skin
          liquefies, before splitting close to the mouth of the snake. The
          entire skin will often come away in a single piece, rolling off the
          reptile’s body as an elongated, inside-out sock. Snakes have long been
          a preoccupation for Crothall, favoured both for their biblical
          symbolism, and their style of locomotion. That whispering slippage
          around the edges of things. The french term <i>serpent</i>, comes from
          the Indo-European <i>serp-</i> ‘to creep’.
        </p>

        <p>
          Snakes exhibit several distinct forms of movement; <i>sidewinding</i>{' '}
          refers to a strange, rolling maneuver used to travel across smooth
          surfaces that offer no traction. In the context of Crothall’s work,
          sidewinding might take on a metaphorical significance; not even the
          most-polished, pristine countertop is safe from the serpent.
          Undulating movements glimpsed in one’s peripheral vision –
          omnipresent, but rarely faced head-on – the forked tongue of
          temptation, and accompanying doom, never too far away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crothall’s series of home-sewn snakes deliberately exaggerate a faux
          aesthetic. Her critters are not meant to be convincing, or realistic.
          There’s a looseness and impatience in these deflated reptiles,
          carelessly draped, darkly hilarious. Imagine The Chocolate Room if
          Goff had liberated himself from the goal of suspending disbelief –
          that’s Crothall’s style. It’s worth noting that the artist originally
          trained as a painter; her early work centred on highly-skilled
          renderings of confectionary and decorations. Crothall’s practice has
          since developed into a nuanced, multi-media creature – deftly
          utilising photography, installation, moving image, sculptural
          elements, text and publishing.
        </p>

        <p>
          This shift from an illustrative, illusory process, towards a complex
          set of framing devices, has widened and deepened Crothall’s
          vocabulary. A preoccupation with texture and surface has emerged, a
          drive towards the darker side of nostalgia, and an interest in
          localised specificity – she often references growing up in
          Christchurch, during the 90’s. In May 2019 Crothall presented{' '}
          <i>Alcala</i>; an exhibition that broke strange new ground. Presented
          in a unit at the Alcala motor lodge, 100 Sherborne Street,
          Christchurch; the artist’s body of work slipped between cream walls,
          fawn carpet, and flesh-tone linen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two publications were inculded in <i>Alcala</i>; the magazine style;{' '}
          <i>Mindful Marinade</i>, and a hardbound book;{' '}
          <i>Snakes of New Zealand</i>. Large-scale images presented in{' '}
          <i>Heat Pits</i> first appeared in this second publication –
          reconfigured here in the artist’s aestheticised parody of a classroom.
          References to a controlling shadow-side of learning environments can
          similarly be traced back to an earlier project; <i>Shelter House</i>,
          2021, a multi-media exhibition for The Physics Room, which introduced
          visual language drawn from retro education posters, religious
          colouring books, and primary school display structures.
        </p>

        <p>
          In resolving a bespoke installation for Rm gallery, Crothall has
          pulled silken threads from both <i>Alcala</i> and <i>Shelter House</i>
          , simplified her presentation strategies, and increased the potency of
          her content. <i>Heat Pits</i> offers viewers a refined menu of
          artistic progression, concentrated in a body of work that is
          confounding, rather brilliant, and very funny. It’s a nightmare
          scotch-egg, wrapped in layers of coded narrative, harbouring cryptic
          secrets...
