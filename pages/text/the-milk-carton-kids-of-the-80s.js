                What should first strike one as they enter this exhibition is not a lightning bolt from
                above (hastily drawn outline), but rather how clearly the texture and obsession, that
                lives within Grace Crothalls aestheticised and reference heavy dialogue, has been
                translated into being.

                The dualitites in the architechture, spatial layout and design dictated by first
                appearances are what appear to initially sit at the core of Shelter House.

                But, as one is accultured into the space, what is gradually exposed is how these
                relationships are purposeful in their disproportion; unevenly prearranged to weigh in
                on a power dynamic. Never reaching equilibrium, the cycle of energy flows one way
                like an hourglass, requiring intervention to be upended. It is a metabolism of sorts.

                Further instituted by the series of texts present in the secondary room; “End time
                Prophecies”, “Love only god”, “this demonstration seeks to teach children about the
                elasticity of sin”; the contradiction of effervescent colouring in, moody hazed painting,
                seductive banners and carpeted walls allow the overall gestalt to float between
                ideology and form; always reasoned to survive conceptually in aesthetic/essence.

                The door seperating the two spaces, glassy and institutional, suggests a
                transparency that does not really exist. The gem that protagonises a quest unspoken,
                what this membrane actually comes to represent is a portent for acid reflux.

                Abject in all regards, as something befitting a body horror advance into satanic panic,
                (and the fluids therein); the bodily exposition is succinctly summarised by a game of
                Operation.

            <p>
                It is to be remembered at this point that Satanic panic is considered to focus on an
                entirely fictitious conspiracy. Framed via a losing battle between tradition and a newly
                secularized world, fantasy bled into reality, media fueling the moral risk society.
                Technology and science were brought close to the center, slickening the sacred
                space into a global mogul.

                If this show was a treatise on fluid it would be about a viscose tapioca like false
                orange cheese. Based on something real but then stretched and sinewy when lifted,
                whipped to a foam on demand.

                Crothall touches on this through purposeful adaptations of capital mainframes and
                neoliberal textures. Further activating the unheimlich corporality. The brand of the
                megachurch, playing with pop culture and big experience, similarily pre-ordained,
                and concreted by highy stylised aesthetics.

                Dealing with the big thematic tropes is never fun nor rarely is it pulled off, but lets be
                clear, Shelter house is very far from a foray into reverence unless you have a keen
                eye for Lynch. So inherently tied to a dialogue of the nineties, this exorcism of potent
                fantasy inebriated with reality, (the ilk from which came the school dungeon and
                fudge cake consumed in Matilda) has a distinct horror tinge to it.

                It is perhaps no mistake that Rosemarys baby is classed as the ultimate satanic film,
                when one comes to consider Horror as the discomfort in domesticity, the antitodote
                (though not proliferated as such) to a nuclear family bundle.

                Shelter House relies on a naievity that only when present, pulls abstract units into a
                running narrative. The sensation that is created, becomes a thing of its own, and it is
                this thing that Crothall speaks to. Exploring complexity through abstraction whilst
                invoking cinematic grammar; dramatic effect here is an ode to Kuleshov, justly
                exposed in the editing.
